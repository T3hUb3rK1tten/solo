## Intro

Hiya! My name is Michael West, I'm an amateur radio operator located in Dallas, TX.

My interests are packet radio, specifically APRS and AREDN, storm spotting, and high altitude balloons. My QTH is near Addison, TX.

Currently my HT radio collection consists of two Baofeng UV-82 and a Baofeng BF-F8HP. For mobile I use a Baofeng UV-5001 and a BTech UV-25X4. I have a NanoStation M2 on my apartment balcony running as an AREDN node. I also use several RTL-SDRs, as well as a RadioShack Pro 106 scanner I bought from N5AET for scanning.

I usually monitor the MARS N5MJQ and DCARA W5NGU repeaters while mobile. I am a member of Denton County ARES and when storm spotting I primarily stick to Denton county.

I took my Technician exam in May 2016 and received my original call KG5NWH. My initials are MAW, so a few months later, I applied and received the call W5MAW. At DEFCON 25 in July 2017, I passed the General exam. 

My contact information (phone, email, etc) is on [my main website](https://mwe.st).
